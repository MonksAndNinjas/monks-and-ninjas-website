What is this app?

  A webpage for my coding blog, maybe even fitness blog (later). It will also
  display portfolio and working code for main projects. It will also display art from my
  my former art website.

What am I currently working on?

  => Change text for bizarre
  => Fix self-portrait in home page
  => Fix ninja photo in home page project section

What are some things to work on later?

  => remove posts from /db and /model and /controller
  => add artwork data to rails API to display alongside art modal
  => delete unneeded npms (google-sign-in, google-picker, react-pdf)
  => make all portfolio images same width and height
  => add now loading display funcitonality
  => remove last border css from home page
  => have projects able to link to it's blog post
  => have correct labeling of class or id for use in css. Sometimes when I have class it should be id.
  => add ability to subscribe to blog or newsletter type thing, notificaitons for new additions
  => make social media icons collapsable and expandable
  => add animation bullet point for about home section

bugs?

  => navbar only displays when hovering over logo not to the right of it
