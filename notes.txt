What is this app?

  A webpage for my coding blog, maybe even fitness blog (later). It will also
  display portfolio and working code for main projects. It will also display art from my
  my former art website.

What am I currently working on?

What are some things to work on later?

  => remove posts from /db and /model and /controller
  => delete unneeded npms (google-sign-in, google-picker, react-pdf)
  => make all portfolio images in home page same width and height
  => add now loading display functionality for all pages as needed
  => have projects able to link to it's blog post
  => add ability to subscribe to blog or newsletter type thing, notifications for new additions
  => make social media icons collapsible and expandable?
  => add animation bullet point for about home section
  => add animation when navbar is expanded such as glitter, or some kind of confetti
  => make blog3 photo larger and blog2 photo black part smaller
  => add symbols for github and video demo in home portfolio
  => add animation for news menu icons
  => Fix ninja photo in home page project section
  => Make folder categories for blog page

bugs?

  => navbar should only displays when hovering over logo not to the right of it
