What is this app?

  A webpage for my coding blog, maybe even fitness blog (later). It will also
  display portfolio and working code for main projects. It will also display art from my
  my former art website.

What am I currently working on?

  => apply css for blog
  => most recent posts in home page
  => display list of blogs and display one full post at a time on the same page

What are some things to work on later?

  => portfolio project and their live code
  => most recent projects displayed in home page
