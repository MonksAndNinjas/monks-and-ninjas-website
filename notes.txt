What is this app?

  A webpage for my coding blog, maybe even fitness blog (later). It will also
  display portfolio and working code for main projects. It will also display art from my
  my former art website.

What am I currently working on?
  => About me philosophy, bio, hobbies

  => pic for blog post
  => video project
  => rearrange formatting for home Project, Project
  => Art data size and dimensions correct
  => remove posts from /db and /model and /controller
  => socialmedia

  => main art for home page

What are some things to work on later?

  => add artwork data to rails API to display alongside art modal
  => delete unneeded npms (google-sign-in, google-picker, react-pdf)
  => add now loading display funcitonality
  => remove last border css from home page
  => have projects able to link to it's blog post
  => have correct labeling of class or id for use in css. Sometimes when I have class it should be id.
  => add ability to subscribe to blog or newsletter type thing, notificaitons for new additions

bugs?

  => portfolio images padding change height at times. needs to be consistent
  => React youtube video in portfolio not working
  => not easy to click on bullet to go to anchors
  => set easing for speed of scroll to anchor
  => navbar only displays when hovering over logo not to the right of it
