What is this app?

  A webpage for my coding blog, maybe even fitness blog (later). It will also
  display portfolio and working code for main projects. It will also display art from my
  my former art website.

What am I currently working on?

  => Home page layout
  => setup anchors
  => most recent posts in home page (3 most recent, with pictures)
  => most recent project displayed in home page (1 project)
  => artwork spotlight (1 piece), most recent (1 piece)
  => About me philosophy, bio, hobbies

What are some things to work on later?

  => add artwork data to rails API to display alongside art modal
  => delete unneeded npms (google-sign-in, google-picker)

bugs?

  => portfolio images padding change height at times. needs to be consistent
  => React youtube video in portfolio not working
