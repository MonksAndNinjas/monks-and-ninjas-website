What is this app?

  A webpage for my coding blog, maybe even fitness blog (later). It will also
  display portfolio and working code for main projects. It will also display art from my
  my former art website.

What am I currently working on?

  => Fix self-portrait in home page and add shadow if saved as svg
  => Fix ninja photo in home page project section
  => review class and id names and usage of css

What are some things to work on later?

  => remove posts from /db and /model and /controller
  => delete unneeded npms (google-sign-in, google-picker, react-pdf)
  => make all portfolio images same width and height
  => add now loading display functionality
  => have projects able to link to it's blog post
  => add ability to subscribe to blog or newsletter type thing, notifications for new additions
  => make social media icons collapsible and expandable
  => add animation bullet point for about home section
  => add animation when navbar is expanded such as glitter, or some kind of confetti
  => make blog3 photo larger and blog2 photo black part smaller

bugs?

  => navbar only displays when hovering over logo not to the right of it
